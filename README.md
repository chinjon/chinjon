### ~~software engineer~~

i enjoy working on projects that solve problems, making the world a better place, no matter how difficult they maybe. i am an avid street/documentary photographer, and can usually be found on the streets of nyc - with a camera in my hand. 

### now

~~i've been looking for new software engineer opportunities, but~~ i have been making plans returning to school (either civil engineering, geographical information systems or public health). 

i am also looking for local organizations in the NYC/lower Westchester area to lend my services with code - such as nonprofits, community-building initatives, unions, etc...

### back then

* i studied media studies at hunter college, with a concentration in journalism
  * i had hoped to have a career in music journalism
    * i immediately re-enrolled into school right after graduation to study nutrition science for a year
* i co-founded a music blog with my friend nadine, called [cereal + sounds](https://www.cerealandsounds.com)
* i held the role of software engineer at a few startups, primarily working with frontend codebases
  * i was laid off at the most recent startup i was a part of. unable to find a role after a year, i decided it was time to move on from the role and industry.
