### ~~software engineer~~

i enjoy working on projects that solve problems, making the world a better place, no matter how difficult they maybe. i am an avid street/documentary photographer, and can usually be found on the streets of nyc - with a camera in my hand. 

### now

as of august 2024, ~~i've looking for new software engineer opportunities, but~~ i have been making plans returning to school (either civil engineering or GIS). 

i am also looking for local organizations in the NYC/lower Westchester area to lend my services with code - such as not-for-profits, community-building initatives, unions, etc...
